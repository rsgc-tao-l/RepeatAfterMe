 ## Notes:
 * the image is exactly 360 pixels wide by 360 pixels high
 * rainbow circles, circles in upper left, and squares in lower right must be exactly as shown
 * the "bites" taken out of the rainbow circle are randomly generated as follows:
 â€‹position varies as high as 50 pixels and as low as 50 pixels below horizontal centre line of image
 * when position is below centre line, opacity is 75%
 * when position is above centre line, opacity is 25%
